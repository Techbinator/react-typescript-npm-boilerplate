# react-typescript-npm-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate that helps creating npm packages using React, Typescript, Jest.
It also provides an example folder initialised with create-react-app where the library can be developed(having hot reload) and also viewed. The demo app can be also deployed using gh-pages, this example can actually be found here: https://techbinator.github.io/react-typescript-npm-boilerplate

## Installation:

Clone the repo

```
npm i
```

## Developing:

To start developing, run `npm start`. It will build your library and run example `create-react-app` where you can test your components. Both the component library and the example create-react-app would run in paralel and will be automatically reloaded if any of the 2 would be modified

## Typescript

This boilerplate lets you develop your libraries in Typescript and you can simultaneously test it in Typescript example create-react-app.
